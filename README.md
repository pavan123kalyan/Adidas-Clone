This project presents a custom clone of the official Adidas website, developed as part of an
advanced web development project. The objective is to create a fully functional and visually
appealing e-commerce platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, mirroring the features and
design aesthetics of the original Adidas site. The website offers a seamless user experience
through an intuitive interface, responsive design, and interactive elements, capturing the
essence of the renowned brand.

In addition to front-end technologies, the project integrates a Node.js backend to manage
customer order details locally. This integration demonstrates a practical approach to handling
e-commerce functionalities, such as user authentication, order processing, and data
management. Node.js facilitates a robust server-side environment, enabling efficient data
storage and retrieval, essential for maintaining customer order histories and ensuring data
integrity.

Your feedback is invaluable as we continue to improve the current state of the project.
